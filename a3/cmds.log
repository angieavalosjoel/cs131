 Task 1.

Q. Assume you were a taxi driver. You want to wait for better customers at a high-earning pickup location. Identify the top 10 pickup locations that yielded the highest average "total amount" in August 2019. Save the output to a3.txt.
Answer the 10 locations and
their average total amount paid by the customers

A. This command gets the top 10 pickup locations

 awk -F , ' { print $8 } ' 2019-08.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > a3.txt

  This command gets the average total amount based on the top 10 pickup locations

 awk -F , '{ if ($8 == "161.0" || $8 == "186.0" || $8 == "132.0" || $8 == "162.0" || $8 == "237.0" || $8 == "230.0" || $8 == "170.0" || $8 == "48.0" || $8 == "236.0" || $8 == "234.0") print $17}' 2019-08.csv | awk '{ total += $1 } END { print total/NR }' >> a3.txt 

Task 2.

Q. Which pickup and dropoff location pair recorded the highest average "total amount" in August 2019? Save the output to a3.txt.

A. This command gets the top pickup and dropoff location pairs

 awk -F , '{ print $8 " " $9 }' 2019-08.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > a3test.txt
 
This command gets the highest average total amount based on the top pickup and dropoff location pairs

awk -F , '{if ($8 == "264.0" && $9 == "264.0") print $17}' 2019-08.csv | awk '{ total += $1 } END { print total/NR }' >> a3.txt
